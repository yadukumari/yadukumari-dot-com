		LAB EXERCISE 03 INSTRUCTIONS:

		For this assignment, you must use at least one each of the three types of styles covered in Chapter 3:

		--Inline
		--Internal
		--External

		You may use the styles to experiment with color, font-family, font-style, font-size, or whatever other properties you choose.

		My "hand-in" for this exercise uses styles as follows:

		--An inline one for h2 elements
		--An internal one for the body element
		--An external one for h3 and p elements

		All of my styles are limited to color experimentation for my eventual site, but that was my choice--not a requirement for your hand-in.

		I will be reviewing your .html and .css source code for this exercise to ensure you have used each of the three required styles.

		Note that you will have to transfer to voyager not just a .html file but also a .css file.

		To hand in this assignment, simply copy/paste the URL of your page into the Canvas assignment.

		<h3>Cooking Website Idea</h3>

		<p>
			One of my favorite hobbies is cooking. I love to try new cuisines. I have seen a lot of different cuisine websites.
			They all are inspired me to create my own website. I think these type of websites helps students, bachelors and women.
			When I came to USA I don't have more experience in cooking at that time these type of website help me a lot,
			but now I have a lot experience related to cooking and even I can prepare delicious food.
			This is the reason why I want to create this type of website.
